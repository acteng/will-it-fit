# Will it fit?

This is an experimental extension to the cross-section check tool. Given input data:

- the available width on roads, at any granularity
- a route
- a set of cross-sections with different minimum width requirements

Split the route and indicate what cross sections fit where.

Attempt to do all of this purely in the browser, leveraging cloud-native file formats for reading subsets of large input data.
